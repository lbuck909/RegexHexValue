# Regular Expressions: Matching a Hex Value

Regular expressions (regex) serve as indispensable tools for extracting targeted information from textual data by querying specific patterns of text. These patterns consist of a combination of both special and ordinary characters, such as the expression *"/xy-23/"*. Regular expressions find extensive application across a multitude of programming languages and facilitate the transformation of data into alternative syntax formats. The creation of a regex can be accomplished through two approaches: invoking the constructor function of the regex object or utilizing a regex literal notation.

## Summary

The focus of this article will explain regular expressions matching a Hex(hexadecimal) value. The following Hex value will be addressed : /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/. The aforementioned snippet of code is used to validate and match hex values, specifically the ones often used to represent different colors. Letâ€™s take a deeper look at each component of the hex value.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
`/^` and `$/` are used to indicate the beginning and end of a pattern. These patterns by themselves do not match any regex, however they indicate the beginning or the end of the string. 
Example: ^Once specifies that the string must begin with the word Once. In the original example you will notice /^# is the beginning of the snippet. The character # operation separates a hexadecimal number from a normal decimal number.

The `$` is used to ensure the string matches the pattern overall. 
Example: `bye$/` indicates the string would need to end with `bye`
